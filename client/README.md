# remfork

remfork is short for `remote fork` - it acts as a stub for forking a `remote process`. The `remote process` can be, for example, an external REST service, a gRPC service or other systems for integration with the OSA "fork" pipeline.

This component fills the gaps between the **OSA** fork mechanism with those systems or applications that don't fit into K8S pods.
